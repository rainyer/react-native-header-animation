# react-native-header-animation

![](header-animation.gif)



This is not a lib project. It's just a lab session on react-native animations, where I explored how to animate a header through the opacity animated property

### Installing

Just clone this repo run `yarn install` then `react-native run-ios` and you are good to go :)
